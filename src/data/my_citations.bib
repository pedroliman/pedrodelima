	abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening accounts for over 60\% of cancer screening costs in the US, prompting recurrent debates about its value. Yet CRC screening remains the main tool to curb overall CRC incidence, mortality, and disparities that affect Black Americans. Using the race-specific CRC-SPIN microsimulation model, we show that CRC screening in the United States simultaneously achieves three goals: it saves lives by preventing 24 deaths per 1,000 Black Americans screened with fecal immunochemical test (FIT) and 26 screened with colonoscopy; saves tax dollars by shifting costs from Medicare to private payers; and reduces racial incidence and mortality disparities, helping offset disparities in CRC survival. Both FIT and colonoscopy screening are cost-effective relative to no screening, with annual FIT remaining the most-cost-effective option. Changes to policy requiring coverage of preventive care services must avoid compromising the effectiveness of CRC screening—arguably the greatest equalizer of cancer disparities.},

	abstract = {Fecal immunochemical test (FIT) performance for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening varies by age and sex, yet most FIT-based screening programs use uniform thresholds. This study assessed the potential benefits of stratifying FIT thresholds based on age and sex.We conducted a meta-analysis of FIT sensitivity and specificity at various positivity thresholds by age and sex. We then used these estimates in two microsimulation models of CRC and projected lifetime clinical outcomes, incremental costs, and quality-adjusted life-years gained (QALYG) from age- and sex-stratified FIT strategies. FIT thresholds ranged from 10 to 50 µg hemoglobin/g feces (µg/g).For current uniform FIT screening (20 µg/g), models projected 85.67 to 122.15 QALYG at incremental costs of -\$982 to \$504 per 1,000 individuals compared to no screening. At equivalent costs to current uniform screening, only one model found stratified FIT approaches cost-effective, yielding a marginal increase of 1.04 and 1.10 QALYG/1,000 females and males, respectively. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of \$100,000/QALYG, both models found stratified FIT cut-offs to be the best strategy, with cut-offs being equal or higher for men and lowest at older ages. Uniform strategies showed comparable effectiveness, falling within one quality-adjusted life day per person of efficient strategies at up to \$112 more per person. Results were sensitive to FIT test performance characteristics and one-time setup costs.Stratifying FIT thresholds by age and sex may be cost-effective compared to current screening. However, the gain in expected health benefits with stratified FIT screening is likely small.},

	abstract = {Using state-level opioid overdose mortality data from 1999-2016, we simulated four time-varying treatment scenarios, which correspond to real-world policy dynamics (ramp up, ramp down, temporary and inconsistent). We then evaluated seven commonly used policy evaluation methods: two-way fixed effects event study, debiased autoregressive model, augmented synthetic control, difference-in-differences with staggered adoption, event study with heterogeneous treatment, two-stage differences-in-differences and differences-in-differences imputation. Statistical performance was assessed by comparing bias, standard errors, coverage, and root mean squared error over 1,000 simulations. Results Our findings indicate that estimator performance varied across policy scenarios. In settings where policy effectiveness diminished over time, synthetic control methods recovered effects with lower bias and higher variance. Difference-in-difference approaches, while offering reasonable coverage under some scenarios, struggled when effects were non-monotonic. Autoregressive methods, although demonstrating lower variability, underestimated uncertainty. Overall, a clear bias-variance tradeoff emerged, underscoring that no single method uniformly excelled across scenarios. Conclusions This study highlights the importance of tailoring the choice of estimator to the expected trajectory of policy effects. In dynamic time-varying settings, particularly when a policy has an anticipated diminishing impact, methods like augmented synthetic controls may offer advantages despite reduced precision. Researchers should carefully consider these tradeoffs to ensure robust and credible state-policy evaluations.},

	abstract = {Purpose
The 2023 American College of Physicians (ACP) guidelines for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening are at odds with the United States Preventive Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines, with the former recommending screening starting at age 50 y and the latter at age 45 y. This article “stress tests” CRC colonoscopy screening strategies to investigate their robustness to uncertainties stemming from the natural history of disease and sensitivity of colonoscopy.
Methods
This study uses the CRC-SPIN microsimulation model to project the life-years gained (LYG) under several colonoscopy CRC screening strategies. The model was extended to include birth cohort effects on adenoma risk. We estimated natural history parameters under 2 different assumptions about the youngest age of adenoma initiation. For each, we generated 500 parameter sets to reflect uncertainty in the natural history parameters. We simulated 26 colonoscopy screening strategies and examined 4 different colonoscopy sensitivity assumptions, encompassing the range of sensitivities consistent with prior tandem colonoscopy studies. Across this set of scenarios, we identify efficient screening strategies and report posterior credible intervals for benefits of screening (LYG), burden (number of colonoscopies), and incremental burden-effectiveness ratios.
Results
Projected absolute screening benefits varied widely based on assumptions, but strategies starting at age 45 y were consistently in the efficiency frontier. Strategies in which screening starts at age 50 y with 10-y intervals were never efficient, saving fewer life-years than starting screening at age 45 y and performing colonoscopies every 15 y while requiring more colonoscopies per person.
Conclusions
Decennial colonoscopy screening initiation at age 45 y remained a robust recommendation. Colonoscopy screening with a 10-y interval starting at age 50 y did not result in an efficient use of colonoscopies in any of the scenarios evaluated.
Highlights
•	
Colorectal cancer colonoscopy screening strategies initiated at age 45 y were projected to yield more life-years gained while requiring the least number of colonoscopies across different model assumptions about disease natural history and colonoscopy sensitivity.
•	
Colonoscopy screening starting at age 50 y with a 10-y interval consistently underperformed strategies that started at age 45 y.},

              Several noninvasive tests for colorectal cancer screening are available, but their effectiveness in settings with low adherence to screening and follow-up colonoscopy is not well documented.
            
            
              Objective
              To assess the cost-effectiveness of and outcomes associated with noninvasive colorectal cancer screening strategies, including new blood-based tests, in a population with low adherence to screening and ongoing surveillance colonoscopy.
            
            
              Design, Setting, and Participants
              The validated microsimulation model used for the decision analytical modeling study projected screening outcomes from 2025 to 2124 for a simulated cohort of 10 million individuals aged 50 years in 2025 and representative of a predominantly Hispanic or Latino patient population served by a Federally Qualified Health Center in Southern California. The simulated population had low adherence to first-step noninvasive testing (45\%), second-step follow-up colonoscopy after an abnormal noninvasive test result (40\%), and ongoing surveillance colonoscopy among patients with high-risk findings at follow-up colonoscopy (80\%).
            
            
              Exposures
              Colorectal cancer screening strategies included no screening, an annual or biennial fecal immunochemical test, a triennial multitarget stool DNA test, and a triennial blood-based test. Using a blood-based test was assumed to increase first-step adherence by 17.5 percentage points.
            
            
              Main Outcomes and Measures
              Outcomes included colorectal cancer incidence and mortality, life-years gained and quality-adjusted life-years gained relative to no screening, costs, and net monetary benefit assuming a willingness to pay of \$100 000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained.
            
            
              Results
              Under realistic adherence assumptions, a program of annual fecal immunochemical testing was the most effective and cost-effective strategy, yielding 121 life-years gained per 1000 screened individuals and a net monetary benefit of \$5883 per person. Triennial blood testing was the least effective, yielding 23 life-years gained per 1000, and was not cost-effective, with a negative net monetary benefit. Annual fecal immunochemical testing with 45\% first-step adherence and 80\% adherence to follow-up and surveillance colonoscopy yielded greater benefit than triennial blood testing with perfect adherence (88 vs 77 life-years gained per 1000).
            
            
              Conclusions and Relevance
              This study suggests that in a federally qualified health care setting, prioritizing the convenience of blood tests over less costly and more effective existing stool-based tests could result in higher costs and worse population-level outcomes. Novel screening modalities should be carefully evaluated for performance in community settings before widespread adoption.},

    abstract = { PurposeTo calibrate Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET)’s SimCRC, MISCAN-Colon, and CRC-SPIN simulation models of the natural history colorectal cancer (CRC) with an emulator-based Bayesian algorithm and internally validate the model-predicted outcomes to calibration targets.MethodsWe used Latin hypercube sampling to sample up to 50,000 parameter sets for each CISNET-CRC model and generated the corresponding outputs. We trained multilayer perceptron artificial neural networks (ANNs) as emulators using the input and output samples for each CISNET-CRC model. We selected ANN structures with corresponding hyperparameters (i.e., number of hidden layers, nodes, activation functions, epochs, and optimizer) that minimize the predicted mean square error on the validation sample. We implemented the ANN emulators in a probabilistic programming language and calibrated the input parameters with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo–based algorithms to obtain the joint posterior distributions of the CISNET-CRC models’ parameters. We internally validated each calibrated emulator by comparing the model-predicted posterior outputs against the calibration targets.ResultsThe optimal ANN for SimCRC had 4 hidden layers and 360 hidden nodes, MISCAN-Colon had 4 hidden layers and 114 hidden nodes, and CRC-SPIN had 1 hidden layer and 140 hidden nodes. The total time for training and calibrating the emulators was 7.3, 4.0, and 0.66 h for SimCRC, MISCAN-Colon, and CRC-SPIN, respectively. The mean of the model-predicted outputs fell within the 95\% confidence intervals of the calibration targets in 98 of 110 for SimCRC, 65 of 93 for MISCAN, and 31 of 41 targets for CRC-SPIN.ConclusionsUsing ANN emulators is a practical solution to reduce the computational burden and complexity for Bayesian calibration of individual-level simulation models used for policy analysis, such as the CISNET CRC models. In this work, we present a step-by-step guide to constructing emulators for calibrating 3 realistic CRC individual-level models using a Bayesian approach.HighlightsWe use artificial neural networks (ANNs) to build emulators that surrogate complex individual-based models to reduce the computational burden in the Bayesian calibration process.ANNs showed good performance in emulating the CISNET-CRC microsimulation models, despite having many input parameters and outputs.Using ANN emulators is a practical solution to reduce the computational burden and complexity for Bayesian calibration of individual-level simulation models used for policy analysis.This work aims to support health decision scientists who want to quantify the uncertainty of calibrated parameters of computationally intensive simulation models under a Bayesian framework. }

	abstract = {Blood-based biomarker tests can potentially change the landscape of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. We characterize the conditions under which blood test screening would be as effective and cost-effective as annual fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) or decennial colonoscopy.We used the three CISNET-Colon models to compare scenarios of no screening, annual FIT, decennial colonoscopy, and a blood test meeting CMS coverage criteria (74\% CRC sensitivity and 90\% specificity). We varied the sensitivity to detect CRC (74\%-92\%), advanced adenomas (AAs, 10\%-50\%), screening interval (1-3 years), and test cost (\$25-\$500). Primary outcomes included quality-adjusted life-years gained (QALYG) from screening and costs for an US average-risk 45-year-old cohort.Annual FIT yielded 125-163 QALYG per 1,000 at a cost of \$3,811-5,384 per person, whereas colonoscopy yielded 132-177 QALYG at a cost of \$5,375-7,031 per person. A blood test with 92\% CRC sensitivity and 50\% AA sensitivity yielded 117-162 QALYG if used every three years and 133-173 QALYG if used every year but would not be cost-effective if priced above \$125 per test. If used every three years, a \$500 blood test only meeting CMS coverage criteria yielded 83-116 QALYG, at a cost of \$8,559-9,413 per person.Blood tests that only meet CMS coverage requirements should not be recommended to patients who would otherwise undergo screening by colonoscopy or FIT due to lower benefit. Blood tests need higher AA sensitivity (above 40\%) and lower costs (below \$125) to be cost-effective.},

	abstract = {Prior to the availability of COVID-19 vaccines, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) served as a primary strategy to mitigate the spread of the disease. However, the efficiency of these interventions relies on understanding and incorporating human behavior into infectious disease models. This study addresses the need for models that better account for the influence of temporal discounting on behavioral dynamics to enhance forecasting accuracy and develop robust mitigation strategies. Our previous research introduced Known Time Horizon (KTH) policies, optimizing social distancing measures based on a central planner{\textquoteright}s rational assessment of the pandemic{\textquoteright}s time frame and associated costs. In this paper, we contrast the KTH policy with a model reflecting myopic decision-making, an extreme form of temporal discounting that emphasizes short-term outcomes over long-term consequences. By comparing the expected social distancing behavior under myopic decision-making with the optimal policy derived from KTH approaches, we elucidate the impact of temporal bias on social distancing practices and assess its implications for infection dynamics and associated costs. We find that myopic policy always results in greater total costs throughout an epidemic compared to a KTH policy. However, each cost component {\textendash} the costs of infection and social distancing {\textendash} derived from a myopic strategy may be either larger or smaller than the component costs for a strategy developed using a full optimization model, depending on the specific parameters involved as myopic decision-makers seek to delay both costs of social distancing and infection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementWe wish to thank the National Cancer Institute (R21CA157571), and the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases (R01AI118705 \&amp; R01AI160240) for providing support in projects that led to preliminary work and ideas that motivated this project.

@article{NascimentodeLima2023,
abstract = {The aftermath of the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic may contribute to the widening of disparities in colorectal cancer (CRC) outcomes due to differential disruptions to CRC screening. This comparative microsimulation analysis uses two CISNET CRC models to simulate the impact of ongoing screening disruptions induced by the COVID-19 pandemic on long-term CRC outcomes. We evaluate three channels through which screening was disrupted: delays in screening, regimen switching, and screening discontinuation. The impact of these disruptions on long-term CRC outcomes was measured by the number of life-years lost due to CRC screening disruptions compared to a scenario without any disruptions. While short-term delays in screening of 3–18 months are predicted to result in minor life-years loss, discontinuing screening could result in much more significant reductions in the expected benefits of screening. These results demonstrate that unequal recovery of screening following the pandemic can widen disparities in CRC outcomes and emphasize the importance of ensuring equitable recovery to screening following the pandemic.},

@article{Nowak2023,
abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has called for swift action from local governments, which have instated non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to curb the spread of the disease. The swift implementation of social distancing policies has raised questions about the costs and benefits of strategies that either aim to keep cases as low as possible (suppression) or aim to reach herd immunity quickly (mitigation) to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. While curbing COVID-19 required blunt instruments, it is unclear whether a less-transmissible and less-deadly emerging pathogen would justify the same response. This paper illuminates this question using a parsimonious transmission model by formulating the social distancing lives vs. livelihoods dilemma as a boundary value problem using calculus of variations. In this setup, society balances the costs and benefits of social distancing contingent on the costs of reducing transmission relative to the burden imposed by the disease. We consider both single-objective and multi-objective formulations of the problem. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is distinct in the sense that strategies emerge from the problem structure rather than being imposed a priori. We find that the relative time-horizon of the pandemic (i.e., the time it takes to develop effective vaccines and treatments) and the relative cost of social distancing influence the choice of the optimal policy. Unsurprisingly, we find that the appropriate policy response depends on these two factors. We discuss the conditions under which each policy archetype (suppression vs. mitigation) appears to be the most appropriate.},

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic required significant public health interventions from local governments. Although nonpharmaceutical interventions often were implemented as decision rules, few studies evaluated the robustness of those reopening plans under a wide range of uncertainties. This paper uses the Robust Decision Making approach to stress-test 78 alternative reopening strategies, using California as an example. This study uniquely considers a wide range of uncertainties and demonstrates that seemingly sensible reopening plans can lead to both unnecessary COVID-19 deaths and days of interventions. We find that plans using fixed COVID-19 case thresholds might be less effective than strategies with time-varying reopening thresholds. While we use California as an example, our results are particularly relevant for jurisdictions where vaccination roll-out has been slower. The approach used in this paper could also prove useful for other public health policy problems in which policymakers need to make robust decisions in the face of deep uncertainty.},

@techreport{Vardavas2020,
abstract = {dence-informed guidance, state and local policymakers have put policies in place quickly and with little evidence to support their choices or little consideration of the potentially serious trade- offs. There is an urgent need for a comprehensive and systematic assessment of potential public health interventions to address COVID-19. In this document, we describe the interdisciplinary and multisectoral approach used to develop a tool to fill that need. The tool provides the information and context that policymakers need now to understand the effects of interventions, weigh the trade-offs between them, and decide when and how these interventions can be relaxed. The tool should be of interest to policymakers and others who wish to use it to understand the potential impacts of various nonpharmaceutical interventions (e.g., school closures, stay-at-home orders) on health and economic outcomes in their communities. This document detailing the methods that underlie the tool will be of interest to policymakers or staff members and researchers who wish to better understand and assess the structure and assumptions of the models and analyses that make up the tool.
