    abstract: `Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening accounts for over 60% of cancer screening costs in the US, prompting recurrent debates about its value. Yet CRC screening remains the main tool to curb overall CRC incidence, mortality, and disparities that affect Black Americans. Using the race-specific CRC-SPIN microsimulation model, we show that CRC screening in the United States simultaneously achieves three goals: it saves lives by preventing 24 deaths per 1,000 Black Americans screened with fecal immunochemical test (FIT) and 26 screened with colonoscopy; saves tax dollars by shifting costs from Medicare to private payers; and reduces racial incidence and mortality disparities, helping offset disparities in CRC survival. Both FIT and colonoscopy screening are cost-effective relative to no screening, with annual FIT remaining the most-cost-effective option. Changes to policy requiring coverage of preventive care services must avoid compromising the effectiveness of CRC screening—arguably the greatest equalizer of cancer disparities.`,

    abstract: `Fecal immunochemical test (FIT) performance for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening varies by age and sex, yet most FIT-based screening programs use uniform thresholds. This study assessed the potential benefits of stratifying FIT thresholds based on age and sex.We conducted a meta-analysis of FIT sensitivity and specificity at various positivity thresholds by age and sex. We then used these estimates in two microsimulation models of CRC and projected lifetime clinical outcomes, incremental costs, and quality-adjusted life-years gained (QALYG) from age- and sex-stratified FIT strategies. FIT thresholds ranged from 10 to 50 µg hemoglobin/g feces (µg/g).For current uniform FIT screening (20 µg/g), models projected 85.67 to 122.15 QALYG at incremental costs of -$982 to $504 per 1,000 individuals compared to no screening. At equivalent costs to current uniform screening, only one model found stratified FIT approaches cost-effective, yielding a marginal increase of 1.04 and 1.10 QALYG/1,000 females and males, respectively. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALYG, both models found stratified FIT cut-offs to be the best strategy, with cut-offs being equal or higher for men and lowest at older ages. Uniform strategies showed comparable effectiveness, falling within one quality-adjusted life day per person of efficient strategies at up to $112 more per person. Results were sensitive to FIT test performance characteristics and one-time setup costs.Stratifying FIT thresholds by age and sex may be cost-effective compared to current screening. However, the gain in expected health benefits with stratified FIT screening is likely small.`,

    abstract: `Using state-level opioid overdose mortality data from 1999-2016, we simulated four time-varying treatment scenarios, which correspond to real-world policy dynamics (ramp up, ramp down, temporary and inconsistent). We then evaluated seven commonly used policy evaluation methods: two-way fixed effects event study, debiased autoregressive model, augmented synthetic control, difference-in-differences with staggered adoption, event study with heterogeneous treatment, two-stage differences-in-differences and differences-in-differences imputation. Statistical performance was assessed by comparing bias, standard errors, coverage, and root mean squared error over 1,000 simulations. Results Our findings indicate that estimator performance varied across policy scenarios. In settings where policy effectiveness diminished over time, synthetic control methods recovered effects with lower bias and higher variance. Difference-in-difference approaches, while offering reasonable coverage under some scenarios, struggled when effects were non-monotonic. Autoregressive methods, although demonstrating lower variability, underestimated uncertainty. Overall, a clear bias-variance tradeoff emerged, underscoring that no single method uniformly excelled across scenarios. Conclusions This study highlights the importance of tailoring the choice of estimator to the expected trajectory of policy effects. In dynamic time-varying settings, particularly when a policy has an anticipated diminishing impact, methods like augmented synthetic controls may offer advantages despite reduced precision. Researchers should carefully consider these tradeoffs to ensure robust and credible state-policy evaluations.`,

    abstract: `Purpose
The 2023 American College of Physicians (ACP) guidelines for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening are at odds with the United States Preventive Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines, with the former recommending screening starting at age 50 y and the latter at age 45 y. This article "stress tests" CRC colonoscopy screening strategies to investigate their robustness to uncertainties stemming from the natural history of disease and sensitivity of colonoscopy.
Methods
This study uses the CRC-SPIN microsimulation model to project the life-years gained (LYG) under several colonoscopy CRC screening strategies. The model was extended to include birth cohort effects on adenoma risk. We estimated natural history parameters under 2 different assumptions about the youngest age of adenoma initiation. For each, we generated 500 parameter sets to reflect uncertainty in the natural history parameters. We simulated 26 colonoscopy screening strategies and examined 4 different colonoscopy sensitivity assumptions, encompassing the range of sensitivities consistent with prior tandem colonoscopy studies. Across this set of scenarios, we identify efficient screening strategies and report posterior credible intervals for benefits of screening (LYG), burden (number of colonoscopies), and incremental burden-effectiveness ratios.
Results
Projected absolute screening benefits varied widely based on assumptions, but strategies starting at age 45 y were consistently in the efficiency frontier. Strategies in which screening starts at age 50 y with 10-y intervals were never efficient, saving fewer life-years than starting screening at age 45 y and performing colonoscopies every 15 y while requiring more colonoscopies per person.
Conclusions
Decennial colonoscopy screening initiation at age 45 y remained a robust recommendation. Colonoscopy screening with a 10-y interval starting at age 50 y did not result in an efficient use of colonoscopies in any of the scenarios evaluated.
Highlights
•
Colorectal cancer colonoscopy screening strategies initiated at age 45 y were projected to yield more life-years gained while requiring the least number of colonoscopies across different model assumptions about disease natural history and colonoscopy sensitivity.
•
Colonoscopy screening starting at age 50 y with a 10-y interval consistently underperformed strategies that started at age 45 y.`,

    abstract: `Importance
              Several noninvasive tests for colorectal cancer screening are available, but their effectiveness in settings with low adherence to screening and follow-up colonoscopy is not well documented.


              Objective
              To assess the cost-effectiveness of and outcomes associated with noninvasive colorectal cancer screening strategies, including new blood-based tests, in a population with low adherence to screening and ongoing surveillance colonoscopy.


              Design, Setting, and Participants
              The validated microsimulation model used for the decision analytical modeling study projected screening outcomes from 2025 to 2124 for a simulated cohort of 10 million individuals aged 50 years in 2025 and representative of a predominantly Hispanic or Latino patient population served by a Federally Qualified Health Center in Southern California. The simulated population had low adherence to first-step noninvasive testing (45%), second-step follow-up colonoscopy after an abnormal noninvasive test result (40%), and ongoing surveillance colonoscopy among patients with high-risk findings at follow-up colonoscopy (80%).


              Exposures
              Colorectal cancer screening strategies included no screening, an annual or biennial fecal immunochemical test, a triennial multitarget stool DNA test, and a triennial blood-based test. Using a blood-based test was assumed to increase first-step adherence by 17.5 percentage points.


              Main Outcomes and Measures
              Outcomes included colorectal cancer incidence and mortality, life-years gained and quality-adjusted life-years gained relative to no screening, costs, and net monetary benefit assuming a willingness to pay of $100 000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained.


              Results
              Under realistic adherence assumptions, a program of annual fecal immunochemical testing was the most effective and cost-effective strategy, yielding 121 life-years gained per 1000 screened individuals and a net monetary benefit of $5883 per person. Triennial blood testing was the least effective, yielding 23 life-years gained per 1000, and was not cost-effective, with a negative net monetary benefit. Annual fecal immunochemical testing with 45% first-step adherence and 80% adherence to follow-up and surveillance colonoscopy yielded greater benefit than triennial blood testing with perfect adherence (88 vs 77 life-years gained per 1000).


              Conclusions and Relevance
              This study suggests that in a federally qualified health care setting, prioritizing the convenience of blood tests over less costly and more effective existing stool-based tests could result in higher costs and worse population-level outcomes. Novel screening modalities should be carefully evaluated for performance in community settings before widespread adoption.`,

    abstract: `There is much focus in the field of HIV prevention research on understanding the impact of social determinants of health (e.g., housing, employment, incarceration) on HIV transmission and developing interventions to address underlying structural drivers of HIV risk. However, such interventions are resource-intensive and logistically challenging, and their evaluation is often limited by small sample sizes and short duration of follow-up. Because they allow for both detailed and large-scale simulations of counterfactual experiments, agent-based models (ABMs) can demonstrate the potential impact of combinations of interventions that may otherwise be infeasible to evaluate in empirical settings and help plan for efficient use of public health resources. There is a need for computational models that are sufficiently realistic to allow for evaluation of interventions that address socio-structural drivers of HIV transmission, though most HIV models to date have focused on more proximal influences on transmission dynamics. Modeling the complex social causes of infectious diseases is particularly challenging due to the complexity of the relationships and limitations in the measurement and quantification of causal relationships linking social determinants of health to HIV risk. Uncertainty exists in the magnitude and direction of associations among the variables used to parameterize the models, the representation of sexual transmission networks, and the model structure (i.e. the causal pathways representing the system of HIV transmission) itself. This paper will review the state of the literature on incorporating social determinants of health into epidemiological models of HIV transmission. Using examples from our ongoing work, we will discuss Uncertainty Quantification and Robust Decision Making methods to address some of the above-mentioned challenges and suggest directions for future methodological work in this area.`

    abstract: `Prior to the development of COVID-19 vaccines, policymakers instituted various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to limit transmission. Prior studies have attempted to examine the extent to which these NPIs achieved their goals of containment, suppression, or mitigation of disease transmission. Existing evidence syntheses have found that numerous factors limit comparability across studies, and the evidence on NPI effectiveness during COVID-19 pandemic remains sparse and inconsistent. This study documents the magnitude and variation in NPI effectiveness in reducing COVID-19 transmission (i.e., reduction in effective reproduction rate [Reff] and daily contact rate) in Italy, the United States, the United Kingdom, and China. Our rapid review and narrative synthesis of existing research identified 126 studies meeting our screening criteria. We selected four contexts with >5 articles to facilitate a meaningful synthesis. This step yielded an analytic sample of 61 articles that used data from China, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We found wide variation and substantial uncertainty around the effectiveness of NPIs at reducing disease transmission. Studies of a single intervention or NPIs that are the least stringent had estimated Reff reductions in the 10–50% range; those that examined so-called "lockdowns" were associated with greater Reff reductions that ranged from 40 to 90%, with many in the 70–80% range. While many studies reported on multiple NPIs, only six of the 61 studies explicitly used the framing of "stringency" or "mild versus strict" or "tiers" of NPIs, concepts that are highly relevant for decisionmakers. Existing evidence suggests that NPIs reduce COVID-19 transmission by 40 to 90 percent. This paper documents the extent of the variation in NPI effectiveness estimates and highlights challenges presented by a lack of standardization in modeling approaches. Further research on NPI effectiveness at different stringency levels is needed to inform policy responses to future pandemics.`,

    abstract: `Purpose
  To calibrate Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET)’s SimCRC, MISCAN-Colon, and CRC-SPIN simulation models of the natural history colorectal cancer (CRC) with an emulator-based Bayesian algorithm and internally validate the model-predicted outcomes to calibration targets.
  Methods
  We used Latin hypercube sampling to sample up to 50,000 parameter sets for each CISNET-CRC model and generated the corresponding outputs. We trained multilayer perceptron artificial neural networks (ANNs) as emulators using the input and output samples for each CISNET-CRC model. We selected ANN structures with corresponding hyperparameters (i.e., number of hidden layers, nodes, activation functions, epochs, and optimizer) that minimize the predicted mean square error on the validation sample. We implemented the ANN emulators in a probabilistic programming language and calibrated the input parameters with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo–based algorithms to obtain the joint posterior distributions of the CISNET-CRC models’ parameters. We internally validated each calibrated emulator by comparing the model-predicted posterior outputs against the calibration targets.
  Results
  The optimal ANN for SimCRC had 4 hidden layers and 360 hidden nodes, MISCAN-Colon had 4 hidden layers and 114 hidden nodes, and CRC-SPIN had 1 hidden layer and 140 hidden nodes. The total time for training and calibrating the emulators was 7.3, 4.0, and 0.66 h for SimCRC, MISCAN-Colon, and CRC-SPIN, respectively. The mean of the model-predicted outputs fell within the 95% confidence intervals of the calibration targets in 98 of 110 for SimCRC, 65 of 93 for MISCAN, and 31 of 41 targets for CRC-SPIN.
  Conclusions
  Using ANN emulators is a practical solution to reduce the computational burden and complexity for Bayesian calibration of individual-level simulation models used for policy analysis, such as the CISNET CRC models. In this work, we present a step-by-step guide to constructing emulators for calibrating 3 realistic CRC individual-level models using a Bayesian approach.
  Highlights
  •	
  We use artificial neural networks (ANNs) to build emulators that surrogate complex individual-based models to reduce the computational burden in the Bayesian calibration process.
  •	
  ANNs showed good performance in emulating the CISNET-CRC microsimulation models, despite having many input parameters and outputs.
  •	
  Using ANN emulators is a practical solution to reduce the computational burden and complexity for Bayesian calibration of individual-level simulation models used for policy analysis.
  •	
  This work aims to support health decision scientists who want to quantify the uncertainty of calibrated parameters of computationally intensive simulation models under a Bayesian framework.`,

    abstract: `Blood-based biomarker tests can potentially change the landscape of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. We characterize the conditions under which blood test screening would be as effective and cost-effective as annual fecal immunochemical testing or decennial colonoscopy. We used the 3 Cancer Information and Surveillance Modeling Network–Colon models to compare scenarios of no screening, annual fecal immunochemical testing, decennial colonoscopy, and a blood test meeting Centers for Medicare & Medicaid (CMS) coverage criteria (74% CRC sensitivity and 90% specificity). We varied the sensitivity to detect CRC (74%-92%), advanced adenomas (10%-50%), screening interval (1-3 years), and test cost ($25-$500). Primary outcomes included quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained from screening and costs for a US average-risk cohort of individuals aged 45 years. Annual fecal immunochemical testing yielded 125-163 QALY gained per 1000 at a cost of $3811-$5384 per person, whereas colonoscopy yielded 132-177 QALY gained at a cost of $5375-$7031 per person. A blood test with 92% CRC sensitivity and 50% advanced adenoma sensitivity yielded 117-162 QALY gained if used every 3 years and 133-173 QALY gained if used every year but would not be cost-effective if priced above $125 per test. Blood tests that only meet CMS coverage requirements should not be recommended to patients who would otherwise undergo screening by colonoscopy or fecal immunochemical testing because of lower benefit. Blood tests need higher advanced adenoma sensitivity (above 40%) and lower costs (below $125) to be cost-effective.`,

    abstract: `Environmental sampling surveillance (ESS) technologies, such as wastewater genomic surveillance and air sensors, have been increasingly adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide valuable information for public health response. However, ESS coverage is not universal, and public health decision-makers need support to choose whether and how to expand and sustain ESS efforts. This paper introduces a model and approach to quantify the value of ESS systems that provide leading epidemiological indicators for pandemic response. Using the COVID-19 pandemic as a base-case scenario, we quantify the value of ESS systems in the first year of a new pandemic and demonstrate how the value of ESS systems depends on biological and societal parameters. Under baseline assumptions, an ESS system that provides a 5-day early warning relative to syndromic surveillance could reduce deaths from 149 (95% prediction interval: 136–169) to 134 (124–144) per 100,000 population during the first year of a new COVID-19-like pandemic, resulting in a net monetary benefit of $1,450 ($609-$2,740) per person. The system's value is higher for more transmissible and deadly pathogens but hinges on the effectiveness of public health interventions. Our findings also suggest that ESS systems would provide net-positive benefits even if they were permanently maintained and pathogens like SARS-Cov-2 emerged once every century or less frequently. Our results can be used to prioritize pathogens for ESS, decide whether and how to expand systems to currently uncovered populations, and determine how to scale surveillance systems' coverage over time.`,

    abstract: `Background & Aims

A blood-based colorectal cancer (CRC) screening test may increase screening participation. However, blood tests may be less effective than current guideline-endorsed options. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) covers blood tests with sensitivity of at least 74% for detection of CRC and specificity of at least 90%. In this study, we investigate whether a blood test that meets these criteria is cost-effective.

Methods

Three microsimulation models for CRC (MISCAN-Colon, CRC-SPIN, and SimCRC) were used to estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of triennial blood-based screening (from ages 45 to 75 years) compared to no screening, annual fecal immunochemical testing (FIT), triennial stool DNA testing combined with an FIT assay, and colonoscopy screening every 10 years. The CMS coverage criteria were used as performance characteristics of the hypothetical blood test. We varied screening ages, test performance characteristics, and screening uptake in a sensitivity analysis.

Results

Without screening, the models predicted 77–88 CRC cases and 32–36 CRC deaths per 1000 individuals, costing $5.3–$5.8 million. Compared to no screening, blood-based screening was cost-effective, with an additional cost of $25,600–$43,700 per quality-adjusted life-year gained (QALYG). However, compared to FIT, triennial stool DNA testing combined with FIT, and colonoscopy, blood-based screening was not cost-effective, with both a decrease in QALYG and an increase in costs. FIT remained more effective (+5–24 QALYG) and less costly (–$3.2 to –$3.5 million) than blood-based screening even when uptake of blood-based screening was 20 percentage points higher than uptake of FIT.

Conclusion

Even with higher screening uptake, triennial blood-based screening, with the CMS-specified minimum performance sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 90%, was not projected to be cost-effective compared with established strategies for colorectal cancer screening.`,

    abstract: `Prior to the availability of COVID-19 vaccines, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) served as a primary strategy to mitigate the spread of the disease. However, the efficiency of these interventions relies on understanding and incorporating human behavior into infectious disease models. This study addresses the need for models that better account for the influence of temporal discounting on behavioral dynamics to enhance forecasting accuracy and develop robust mitigation strategies. Our previous research introduced Known Time Horizon (KTH) policies, optimizing social distancing measures based on a central planner’s rational assessment of the pandemic’s time frame and associated costs. In this paper, we contrast the KTH policy with a model reflecting myopic decision-making, an extreme form of temporal discounting that emphasizes short-term outcomes over long-term consequences. By comparing the expected social distancing behavior under myopic decision-making with the optimal policy derived from KTH approaches, we elucidate the impact of temporal bias on social distancing practices and assess its implications for infection dynamics and associated costs. We find that myopic policy always results in greater total costs throughout an epidemic compared to a KTH policy. However, each cost component – the costs of infection and social distancing – derived from a myopic strategy may be either larger or smaller than the component costs for a strategy developed using a full optimization model, depending on the specific parameters involved as myopic decision-makers seek to delay both costs of social distancing and infection.`,

Can the American society reach a stage where past disparities are mended, economic opportunity is expanded, and where everyone gets their fair share? Are such goals mathematically feasible, and if so, over what timeframe? What policies could achieve these goals? For many, questions like these evoke a very strong response. Some may immediately object, arguing that America is and has always been a land of opportunity for all races and groups--a leading democracy that delivered prosperity through free markets. Others will say America has never been a land of opportunity for all--particularly for Black Americans. No matter where you lie along this spectrum, we invite you to dive into mathematical facts about racial wealth disparity in America and models that help shed light on America's wealth disparity struggle. Building on our recently released report describing the headwinds of a long and incessant racial wealth gap, we introduce a measure of racial wealth disparity and characterize the wealth distribution among Black and white US households. Next, we frame America's racial wealth disparity challenge within a computational optimization setting where the social objective is to close racial wealth gaps at a minimal cost. Finally, we discuss how models that describe long-term dynamics of wealth accumulation--specifically, overlapping generation (OLG) models--can be used to investigate whether the United States can ever become a country free of racial wealth disparities.`,

    abstract: `Background: Policy evaluation studies that assess how state-level policies affect health-related outcomes are foundational to health and social policy research. The relative ability of newer analytic methods to address confounding, a key source of bias in observational studies, has not been closely examined.

Methods: We conducted a simulation study to examine how differing magnitudes of confounding affected the performance of 4 methods used for policy evaluations: (1) the two-way fixed effects difference-in-differences model; (2) a 1-period lagged autoregressive model; (3) augmented synthetic control method; and (4) the doubly robust difference-in-differences approach with multiple time periods from Callaway-Sant'Anna. We simulated our data to have staggered policy adoption and multiple confounding scenarios (i.e., varying the magnitude and nature of confounding relationships).

Results: Bias increased for each method: (1) as confounding magnitude increases; (2) when confounding is generated with respect to prior outcome trends (rather than levels), and (3) when confounding associations are nonlinear (rather than linear). The autoregressive model and augmented synthetic control method had notably lower root mean squared error than the two-way fixed effects and Callaway-Sant'Anna approaches for all scenarios; the exception is nonlinear confounding by prior trends, where Callaway-Sant'Anna excels. Coverage rates were unreasonably high for the augmented synthetic control method (e.g., 100%), reflecting large model-based standard errors and wide confidence intervals in practice.

Conclusions: In our simulation study, no single method consistently outperformed the others, but a researcher's toolkit should include all methodologic options. Our simulations and associated R package can help researchers choose the most appropriate approach for their data.`,

This paper extends a competitive dynamics model to investigate tradeoffs associated with selective openness R&D strategies in the professional-grade additive manufacturing (AM) industry. We start by examining whether a competitive dynamics model supports selective openness strategies from a profit-maximization standpoint. We then evaluate the industry-level impacts of selective openness.

The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results incidence rate data in people diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 45 years, before routine CRC screening is recommended, were analyzed to estimate temporal changes in CRC risk in Black and White populations. There was a rapid rise in rectal and distal colon cancer incidence in the White population but not the Black population, and little change in proximal colon cancer incidence for both groups. In 2014-2018, CRC incidence per 100 000 was 17.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 15.3 to 19.9) among Black individuals aged 40-44 years and 16.6 (95% CI = 15.6 to 17.6) among White individuals aged 40-44 years; 42.3% of CRCs diagnosed in Black patients were proximal colon cancer, and 41.1% of CRCs diagnosed in White patients were rectal cancer. Analyses used a race-specific microsimulation model to project screening benefits, based on life-years gained and lifetime reduction in CRC incidence, assuming these Black–White differences in CRC risk and location. The projected benefits of screening (via either colonoscopy or fecal immunochemical testing) were greater in the Black population, suggesting that observed Black–White differences in CRC incidence are not driven by differences in risk. Projected screening benefits were sensitive to survival assumptions made for Black populations. Building racial disparities in survival into the model reduced projected screening benefits, which can bias policy decisions.`,

We evaluate three channels through which screening was disrupted: delays in screening, regimen switching, and screening discontinuation. The impact of these disruptions on long-term CRC outcomes was measured by the number of life-years lost due to CRC screening disruptions compared to a scenario without any disruptions. While short-term delays in screening of 3–18 months are predicted to result in minor life-years loss, discontinuing screening could result in much more significant reductions in the expected benefits of screening. These results demonstrate that unequal recovery of screening following the pandemic can widen disparities in CRC outcomes and emphasize the importance of ensuring equitable recovery to screening following the pandemic.`,

    abstract: `The COVID-19 pandemic has called for swift action from local governments, which have instated non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to curb the spread of the disease. The swift implementation of social distancing policies has raised questions about the costs and benefits of strategies that either aim to keep cases as low as possible (suppression) or aim to reach herd immunity quickly (mitigation) to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. While curbing COVID-19 required blunt instruments, it is unclear whether a less-transmissible and less-deadly emerging pathogen would justify the same response. This paper illuminates this question using a parsimonious transmission model by formulating the social distancing lives vs. livelihoods dilemma as a boundary value problem using calculus of variations. In this setup, society balances the costs and benefits of social distancing contingent on the costs of reducing transmission relative to the burden imposed by the disease. We consider both single-objective and multi-objective formulations of the problem. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is distinct in the sense that strategies emerge from the problem structure rather than being imposed a priori. We find that the relative time-horizon of the pandemic (i.e., the time it takes to develop effective vaccines and treatments) and the relative cost of social distancing influence the choice of the optimal policy. Unsurprisingly, we find that the appropriate policy response depends on these two factors. We discuss the conditions under which each policy archetype (suppression vs. mitigation) appears to be the most appropriate.`,

However, uncertainty surrounding the longevity of vaccine and infection-induced immunity, the emergence and characteristics of SARS‐CoV‐2 variant strains, and behavioral responses to policy interventions prevent modelers from providing more than a few weeks of model-based foresight. Under those conditions, policymakers have options to control the pandemic, but deep uncertainties deny the prediction of their long-term effects. Robust Decision Making (RDM) is a set of methods and tools designed to inform decisions under conditions of deep uncertainty. This dissertation presents three papers exploring the utility of RDM for supporting health policy decisions. The first paper discusses how public health decision-makers may benefit from RDM, using pandemic response policies as a motivating example. The second paper presents a stress test of California's COVID-19 reopening strategy, demonstrating that adaptive reopening plans are superior to non-adaptive ones. The third evaluates the robustness of colorectal cancer screening strategies to uncertainties surrounding the natural history of the disease. Finally, this dissertation reflects on the broader applicability of RDM to health policy decision-analytic problems and reflects on future research directions.`,

This study uniquely considers a wide range of uncertainties and demonstrates that seemingly sensible reopening plans can lead to both unnecessary COVID-19 deaths and days of interventions.

Standard sensitivity assumptions, consistent with published decision analyses, assume sensitivity equal to 0.75 for diminutive adenomas (<6 mm), 0.85 for small adenomas (6-10 mm), 0.95 for large adenomas (≥10 mm), and 0.95 for preclinical cancer. We also selected adenoma sensitivity that resulted in more accurate predictions. Targets were drawn from the Wheat Bran Fiber study. We examined how well the model predicted outcomes measured over a three-year follow-up period, including the number of adenomas detected, the size of the largest adenoma detected, and incident colorectal cancer. Results: Using standard sensitivity assumptions, the model predicted adenoma prevalence that was too low (42.5% versus 48.9% observed, with 95% confidence interval 45.3%-50.7%) and detection of too few large adenomas (5.1% versus 14.% observed, with 95% confidence interval 11.8%-17.4%). Predictions were close to targets when we set sensitivities to 0.20 for diminutive adenomas, 0.60 for small adenomas, 0.80 for 10- to 20-mm adenomas, and 0.98 for adenomas 20 mm and larger. Conclusions: Colonoscopy may be less accurate than currently assumed, especially for diminutive adenomas. Alternatively, the CRC-SPIN model may not accurately simulate onset and progression of adenomas in higher-risk populations. Impact: Misspecification of either colonoscopy sensitivity or disease progression in high-risk populations may affect the predicted effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening. When possible, decision analyses used to inform policy should address these uncertainties.See related commentary by Etzioni and Lange, p. 702.",

    abstract: `Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to present a method for assisting micro and small companies of the industrial sector with the adoption of Lean practices.

Design/methodology/approach
The paper outlines the method construction steps, which used a design science research approach.

Findings
This research led to the structuring of a method for implementing Lean Manufacturing tools in micro and small companies of the industrial sector. The developed method contributed to the knowledge in Lean Manufacturing by systematizing its tools in a heuristic approach that can be applied to an operation using overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) as a guiding indicator.

Practical implications
This method can be used to guide the implementation of Lean tools in SMEs industries.

Originality/value
The originality of this paper lies in the adoption of an operation-focused approach only (rather than an approach that begins with the mapping of an entire process) and the use of OEE as the basis for prioritization of improvements to be performed and operational control.`,

However, local socio-economic factors influence towards SMEs service quality is still unknown. We conducted statistical analyses to observe the relationship between contextual socio-economic factors of an SME's city and its service's quality performance using a SERVPERF survey database of more than 3,000 Brazilian SMEs. While service performance did not linearly correlate with the analysed socio-economic factors, a closer look at the data shows significant differences in service performance among groups of SMEs on highly developed and underdeveloped cities from the other cities. The paper discusses theoretical and managerial implications derived from these findings and proposes new research questions to generate data-backed knowledge to support SMEs service quality improvement.`,
